<h4 align="center">A simple, minimalistic approach to browsing the web.</h4>





<h3 align="left">Why Use Panther?</h3>

* Great for Old PC's, where any boost in performance is significant.
* Great for New PC's, if you value speed and simplicity.
* Great for your privacy, a safe browser that won't take your information.
* Simple to set up, easy to use - all in one executable. **not yet :,)**
* Default search engine is DuckDuckGo, a secure search engine.
<h3 align="center">Prerequisites and Installation:</h3>

* Install Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Then, run the setup script (make sure to add to PATH). Next, you will also need pip. In some python versions, it comes with it, but you may need to install it. If it doesn't come with your python, look up how to get it for your operating system.
* Download the ZIP file from releases, and unzip it to your desktop.
* After you've done that, simply open up a command prompt/terminal in the folder.
* Next, run **py -m pip install -r requirements.txt** to install the necessary modules. If that does not work for any reason, it will attempt to install them when you launch the browser.
* Now, type **python Panther.py** and the browser will launch!
* Please note: you can put it anywhere and make a shortcut as you would with any other browser if you desire. 
* For advanced users: If you prefer to have a different search engine when you launch the browser, enter the code and where it says "https://duckduckgo.com" replace it with the search engine of your choice. 

**AT THE MOMENT THIS BROWSER IS IN A BETA STATE, SO IT IS SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO GET UP AND RUNNING. IT IS ALSO MISSING A NEW TAB FEATURE. IN FUTURE VERSIONS, I WILL MAKE IT AN EXECUTABLE AND ADD FEATURES. IF YOU WOULD LIKE, YOU CAN LOOK AT THE SOURCE AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EASE OF USE IN AN ISSUE ON THIS REPOSITORY.**
